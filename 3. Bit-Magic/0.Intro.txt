Bit Manipulation or Bit Magic:-

Positions in Binary number start from 0;
If any position is 1 , then its call set bit.
If any position is 0, then its call unset bit.

LSB(Least significant Bit):  0 position
MSB(Most significant Bit): Highest position

Now operators &, |, ^, <<, >>, ~

in signed integers last bit or leftmost beat is for sign if 0 then + if 1 then -;
Negetive numbers mostly store in 2's compliment

Brian kerningthan algorithm:-
      N&(N-1) => use for ubset most right setbit

Find right most bit:-
      N & ~(N-1) 

Unset a bit:- a & ~(1<<nth)


In Xor all 4 multiples in ans of a series

NB: In question make sure there are Nth bit and position  are different
