so there are many things in Mathematics :- (It is only important for cp)

1. count of digits: return floor(log10(n)+1)
2. arithmatic: ((ft-lt)/2)*n
3. geomatric probotion: 
4. Qudratic Equation: ax^2 + bx + c =0
                      D= b^2-4ac
                      D>0 two distinct root
                      D<0 imiginary roots
                      D=0 two equal roots
5. Mean: numbers / how many numbers = 4;
6. Median: which is middle of all numbers after arrange in increasing order
7.Prime number: only devided by 1 and this number
8. permutation: arrangement r things that can be done total of n things
                npr= n!/(n-r)!

9. Combination: selection of r things that can be done total n things    
                ncr= n!/r!(n-r)!              

10. '%' : use mpdulo for prevent integer overflow
11. GCD & LCM: a*b= lcm of ab * gcd of ab

there are two main algorithms: 
          1. Euclidean algorithm: use to find gcd by -
                                 if(a<b){
                                    b= b-a;
                                 }
                                 else{
                                     a=a-b;
                                 }

          2. Sieave of eeratothenis:
                    to find a number of primes...
                    so its  we just nedd to make a array of that number and try to make all cells false of there factor cells like  2nd cell start to make false 4,6,8... and so on.... after that only true cells are prime numbers
